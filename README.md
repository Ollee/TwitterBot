# Twitter Bot Modified by Ollee

This is a modified version of Cozy's JS Twitter Bot. This version automatically retweets every new tweet inside of a specific hashtag. Note: this is intended for relatively inactive hashtags, but SHOULD limit your account from over retweeting. You can watch it run(`node bot.js`) to test it and while you do it should print out each time it tweets and each time it fetches a list, it will fetch the remaining tweets allowed until the refresh time.

# Old README: TwitterBot
A simple bot that uses node.js package Twit to find certain hastags to retweet and favorite tweets. It also uses the
stream function of the API to reply to follows.
